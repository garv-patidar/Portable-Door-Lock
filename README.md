# Portable Door Lock

With growing awareness of security issues, homeowners and travelers are seeking advanced, portable, and cost-effective security solutions. Current smart locks have several limitations:  
- High cost  
- Lack of portability  
- Complex installations (e.g., drilling or carrying screwdrivers)  

Traditional locks, on the other hand, lack advanced features.  

**To address these challenges, we designed the Portable Door Lock.**

- **Affordable**: Cost-effective compared to existing smart locks.  
- **No complex installations**: Requires no tools like screwdrivers or drills.
